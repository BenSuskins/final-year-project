# Extracting Knowledge About the Usage of Hate Speech from Social Media.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BenSuskins/final-year-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BenSuskins/final-year-project)

University of Essex BSc Computer Science Final Year Project.

This project uses Social Media sites such as Twitter to extract knowledge about the usage of Hate Speech online.

The system is developed in Java 8 with Spring Boot backed by a PostgreSQL database feeding data into Grafana for monitoring and visualisation.  

A deployed version of the system can be found [Here](www.hatespeech.suskins.co.uk).

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
Software:

cd ..
docker-compose up
```

[Local Application](localhost:80)

### Versioning Strategy
Using Semantic Versioning:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

My Minimum Viable Product is tagged as 1.0.0

### Version History
1.0.0 Initial Release | Twitter Integration | Grafana Visualisation | Hate Speech Trained Classifier. - 08/12/2018.

2.0.0 Reworked API | Control Interface | Retrained Hate Speech Model. - 23/01/2019.
